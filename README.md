## 2| PREPARE <a name="prepare"></a>

Dataset: [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) via [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic) on Kaggle  
Version: Version 2 (updated 2024-03-02 by Mobius)  
License: CC0 Public Domain

Date Range: 2016-03-12 to 2016-05-12 (grouped by 03-12 to 04-11 and 04-12 to 05-12)  
Data Collection: survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk  
Sample Size: 30 Fitbit users who consented to submission of their personal tracker data  
Data: minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring

Data Limitations
- From the extracted 31 CSV files representing 18 datasets, only 11 encompassed the entire date range while the other 7 spanned only half of the date range.
- Date range of data spans 2 months during 2016, which at this time is relatively outdated. A longer time span would have also been preferred.
- Sample size is said to be 30 users which is the minimum usually required to accurately represent the population. turns out 35 unique users.
- Users' privacy is kept by referring to them by ID. However there is no additional demographic data that determines gender, age, location etc. It is undetermined if the sample size is representative of the population. Furthermore, Bellabeat produces products specifically for women, the lack of demographic information impacts the relevancy of any insights found.
- Product data also is not present. We don't know which Fitbit products and models collected and tracked the available data.

## 3| PROCESS <a name="process"></a>
Tools: PostgreSQL, Tableau

Datasets Selected (8)
- minuteSleep_merged.csv
- minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv
- minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv
- minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv
- minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv
- heartrate_seconds_merged.csv
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- weightLogInfo_merged.csv

These datasets were selected because they encompassed the entire date range and contains metrics that are relevant to the business task without being redundant.

Verified
- count of unique IDs
- date range and total number of unique dates
- all values fell within reasonable range for their field
- any null data
- removal of duplicate records

Weight, sleep, and heart rate data were disqualified due to samples sizes having less than 30 total participants.

Sleep: 25 participants
Heart Rate: 15 participants
Weight: 8 participants

Across all datasets there were 35 unique participants.  
However, only 33 will be considered during analysis. Participant 2891001357 and 6391747486 were removed due data inconsistency and data absence.

All datasets were added to the database as their own table. Tables with date-time information was merged into a new combined table for analysis. Tables that had integers representing qualitative data was updated based on the data dictionary e.g.  sleep values with "1" were updated to "asleep."

## 4| ANALYZE <a name="analyze"></a>
Percentage of total days and days with a step count greater than 0 was calculated for each user. Users who had a step count more than 50% of their tracked days was typed as an "active" user. Users who had a step count less than 50% of their tracked days was typed as a "sedentary" user.

Insights
- activity remains relatively constant between weekdays and user types
- active users have a higher step count and spend more time in elevated intensities and MET scores than sedentary users, although the impact on calories burned is extremely minimal
- active users have a higher chance of tracking more metrics (e.g. sleep, weight, heart rate) compared to sedentary users

## ACT <a name="act"></a>
### Recommendations
The marketing team can apply these insights by promoting features on the Bellabeat app. Beallabeat's Leaf and Time track similar activity to the Fitbit data. Leaf and Time do not have screens allowing users to view data or change setting directly through the smart device.

Encouraging users to use the Bellabeat app allows them to fully explore the capabilities of Bellabeat products and make the most out of their data. For example, notifications and pop-ups can be utilized to remind and encourage users to increase their activity or input manually tracked data.
### Further Analysis
Further analysis should be done to get more accurate insights. 

When selecting and gathering data for future analysis the limitations of the data from this report should be kept in mind so the gaps can be filled.

Bellabeat can look for other datasets from Fitbit and other smart device companies within the fitness and wellness industry. They can also survey their own client base to see how they already use Bellabeat products and what features current users are interested in adding.
